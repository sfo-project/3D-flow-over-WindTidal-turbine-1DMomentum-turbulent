    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**The created CFD domain is now created inside the CFD package of interest to setup and then run the CFD simulation. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis for different flow conditions are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end users will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions.**\n",

    "## Setting up a CFD simulation has following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the physics of the flow field user will select required model/s to simulate the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "User will define the physical and thermodynamical properties of the working fluid/s and solid/s in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Initial Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the governing equations of the flow (i.e. system of partial differential equations) requires set of well-defined boundary and initial conditions within the CFD domain. These conditions are selected and defined in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CFD simulations the governing equations of the flow are solve numerically. Based on the physics of the problem appropriate numerical schemes and solution methods are selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section the details for the above-mentioned four steps, for the CFD simulation setup of **3D flow over a scaled model horizontal axis tidal turbine** in **STAR-CCM+** are explained in great details. In this case study the effect of the turbine is modeled using **Virtual Disk/1D Linear Momentum Model**. In this tutorial the paths for defining conditions and other settings are provided in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">command line</span> format and when a double click is requires it is denoted by <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">[double click]</span> symbol. Users can easily access the noted settings and options by following the provided path and use clicks when necessary. The summary of the steps to setup the CFD simulation is shown in the visualized tree of progress in Fig. 1: \n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the CFD domain is created in the STAR-CCM+ solver the required models to perform CFD simulation can be set inside the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Continua</span> folder using <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Continua\\Physics 1\\Models\\ [double click]</span> pathway. This opens a new window, where the desired models to perform the CFD simulation can be selected. It should be noted that once users select each model the other relative and required models will become available in this windows to choose from. The required models for the current case study as they become available after clicking on each option are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Space</span>: In this case study the experimental setup, boundary and operating conditions [1] are fully modeled. Therefor, the problem is defined to be <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Three dimensional</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Time</span>: The main assumption in the problem of flow over a scaled horizontal axis tidal turbine is that the free stream flow is uniform and steady. Furthermore, the effect of rotating blades are simplified and averaged over a cycle of rotation using the 1D Linear Momentum Theory. Therefore, the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Steady</span> model is chosen to develop the CFD simulation. In cases where the flow properties rapidly changes with respect to time within the boundaries of the flow or flow over rotating blades of turbine is modeled using the actual geometry of the turbine at each time step the appropriate unsteady model of interest should be selected during CFD simulation setup step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Material</span>: Unless the users are obligated with the choice of the working fluid type, it is recommended to choose <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Liquid</span> as the defined material and set it's properties later to match the most important groups of non-dimensional variables within the flow field (e.g. Reynolds number). The procedure to set the properties of the working fluid in STAR-CCM+ will be discussed shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Flow</span>: The model to simulate the flow should be selected at this step. The flow for current case study is assumed to be incompressible (i.e. Ma # < 0.3), therefore pressure and velocity field are the two variables to solve for. Hence <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Segregated Flow</span> is the recommended model in which the pressure and velocity field will be found separately by solving the flow field governing equations numerically. In cases that the speed of the flow enters sonic and supersonic regimes ( Ma # > 0.3 ), the changes in pressure and density of the flow will be significantly important factor and users should pick the Coupled Flow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Equation of State</span>: In this problem we are considering that the flow is in subsonic regime. Therefore, variation of density with respect to the pressure can be neglected. As a result of this assumption one can define the working fluid to be incompressible and the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Constant Density</span> option is chosen for the equation of state of this problem. In cases that the speed of the flow enters sonic and supersonic regimes ( Mach # > 0.3 ), the changes in density (i.e. compressibility) of the flow will be an important factor and users should pick the relevant model from this menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Viscous Regime</span>: In the current problem the focus is to investigate the turbulent flow field around and in the wake of the scaled model turbine. The Reynolds number of the flow in the experiment, based on turbines chord length, is about $10^5$ [1]. Hence, the flow regime is turbulent and the appropriate model for flow would be <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Turbulent</span>. After defining the regime of the flow to be turbulent users should also choose the type of closure model for solving Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. This choice strongly depends on the value of Reynolds number and the desire turbulent features of the flow to be simulated. For very high Reynolds number flows Spalat-Allmaras is one of the first recommended models. K-Omega and K-Epsilon models also have their defined limitations and capabilities. In this work according to the previous experiences and knowledge based on previous numerical studies **K-Omega** closure model combined is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It should be noted that selection of the **K-Omega** closure model by default includes the **SST (Mentor)** correction, **All y+ Wall Treatment** and **Exact Wall Distances** as the closure model correction and algorithm to model the turbulent boundary layer close to the walls within the flow field. It is extremely important for users to understand the functionality of these models selected by default and change them if necessary. For the current case study of interest, as discussed in the Domain section, the required mesh resolution is provided along the walls of the nacelle and flume walls to capture the formed turbulent boundary layer. Therefore, the **All y+ Wall Treatment** which is a combination of two models to fully resolving and/or estimating the turbulent boundary layer along walls using and empirical relationship is chosen here. Users should note that this choice would increase the level of computational time and cost of the simulation. Hence, other options might be a better fit based on the physics of the problem and should be considered at this stage [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Virtual Disk</span>: The last model to choose is the one to implement the 1D Linear Momentum for simulation of turbine operation within the flow field. This model is among **Optional Models** panel and is called **Virtual Disk**. Details of the required settings for this model is presented in the boundary condition setup section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "During selection of the required models to setup the current CFD simulation, the type of Material was selected as Liquid. After this selection an option becomes available under <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\Continua\\Physics 1\\Models\\Liquid</span> path, where the properties of the working fluid (i.e. Density and Viscosity) in CFD simulation can be set. The working fluid properties strongly depend on physics of the problem. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest (e.g. Reynolds number) is matched the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainties in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the basis for expected physical observations. For the current case study, however, the goal is to simulate the experimental conditions and setup. The working fluid in the experiment is the river water re-directed into the flume section. Hence, the predefined liquid material from <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">H2O</span> is left unchanged as the selected working fluid in this simulation. As seen here in most of the CFD packages, water or air is the pre-defined working fluid. Hence, users can alternatively modify the working fluid via the above options to define a new material with unique physical and thermodynamical properties as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1 Setup Boundary and Initial Conditions:**    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem the entire CFD domain is defined as one united <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fluid</span> accessible under the folder of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Regions</span>. The types of boundary and initial conditions for this CFD simulation are set in each sub-folder of this <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fluid</span> section. The steps to define these settings are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Regions\\fluid\\Boundaries</span> path has the name of the boundary faces of the CFD domain. These names are assigned during the creation of CFD domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The flow is bounded by the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">walls</span> faces on the sides of the CFD domain. Flow interacts with these boundaries based on free-slip boundary condition. Meaning that the flow can slip freely along these walls and no turbulent boundary layer will form along these boundaries. User assign the free-slip boundary condition to this faces of the domain via a double click on the name of the walls boundary and set the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Physical Conditions/Shear Stress Specification/Method</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Slip</span>. The set free-slip wall condition would match the experimental blockage ration of 20%, while idealizes the effect of formed turbulent boundary layers in the experiment. The hypothesis here is that this effect is minimal, therefore simplification of that at this stage is a valid assumption to save computational cost and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The flow can exit the CFD domain from the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">outlet</span> face and it's pressure will be equal to atmospheric pressure (i.e. zero gauge pressure). Users assign the boundary condition to this face of the CFD domain by a double click on the name of the face and set the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Type</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Pressure Outlet</span> and the value of the pressure via <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Physics Values/Pressure/Value</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">0~[Pa]</span> as the gauge pressure. This boundary condition suggests that the outlet face is far from the turbine place in the flume such that the pressure of the flow recovers the atmospheric pressure or zero gauge pressure at this boundary. If in the problem of interest, there exist a specific pressure difference between the inlet and outlet or other surfaces, that magnitude can be set in corresponding faces of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the experiment the flow enters the flume from inlet face with constant and uniform velocity of $1.13 [\\frac{m}{s}]$ with an almost horizontal directionality. To simulate this condition users can assign the boundary condition to this face named inlet by a double click on the name of the face and set the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Type</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Velocity Inlet</span> and <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Physics Conditions/Velocity Specification/Methods</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Components</span>. To setup velocity values users can use <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Physics Values/Velocity/Values</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">[1.13 , 0 , 0]</span>. In cases where the incoming velocity into the CFD domain is not uniform and has different components, one can define the incoming velocity with the pre-defined directions or generate a user defined function to set the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, at the inlet boundary the flow field turbulent properties can be set by user. Users can assign these condition using path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Physics Conditions/Turbulence Specification/Methods</span> and set the condition <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Intensity + Length Scale</span> to it. To setup value of measured turbulence intensity of 10% users set <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Physics Values/Turbulence Intensity/Values</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">0.1</span>. To setup value of turbulence length scale users set <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Physics Values/Turbulence Length Scale/Values</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">0.1 [m]</span>. This value is based on an average estimate of various geometrical aspects of the turbine structure such as average chord length, nacelle diameter and height of the flume and experimental measurements of the turbulence length scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "* After setting the boundary conditions, initial conditions values should be set for the CFD simulations. These conditions can be thought as initial numerical guesses to start the iterative process of numerical simulation of the flow field. The path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Regions/fluid/Physics Conditions/Initial Condition Option</span> opens a window to set the initial values for Pressure, Turbulent flow properties and Velocity within the CFD domain. The current CFD simulation of interest would be initialized by the flow field variables values at the inlet of the CFD domain. Meaning that for the set initial values of all variables is set to their corresponding values at the inlet boundary condition, as explained above. In majority of case studies initialization of the flow field using the values at the inlet of the domain is a good start point and would result into a smooth convergence trend. However, for more complex problems were the flow is unsteady or the simulation's computational time is high initialization of the CFD domain with previously developed time step solutions is a possibility that users can consider. Alternatively, users can set these initial condition values via path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Continua/Initial Conditions</span>.\n",

    "**3.2 Setup Boundary Conditions on the Rotor Face of the Turbine:**    \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained earlier in the Physics section of this case study the effect of turbine rotating blades is simulated via the **1D Linear Momentum** theory. This implementation is done via input of the settings in the path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Continua/Models/Virtual Disk</span>. User can define multiple turbine rotor zones using <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">right click/Virtual Disk/New</span> path. In the newly generated folder of Virtual Disk using the path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Continua/Models/Virtual Disk/Method/1D Linear Momentum Method</span> one can enable the implementation of this model for simulation of turbine operation. The turbine geometrical and operational conditions will be set under other sub-directories of this folder as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Virtual Disk\\Power Curve</span>: this is the folder to set the Method and place of Thrust-Torque as a function of incoming velocity lookup table. Users set the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Virtual Disk\\Power Curve\\Method</span> to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Table (Wind Speed)</span> to enable the option of a lookup table of power and thrust coefficient values as a function of velocity. Under table properties user can select the previously lookup table via path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Tools/Tables/New Table/File Table</span>. The **.csv** file of the power and thrust coefficient lookup table is available in the **Simulation_Src** folder of this repository. This lookup table was developed in a third party software named Q-Blade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Virtual Disk\\Disk Geometry</span> folder is the place to define various geometrical properties of the rotor zone where the effect of rotating blades is modeled via body forces as follows: $Inner~Radius~=~0.1~[m]$, $Outer~Radius~=~0.225~[m]$, $Thickness~=~0.03~[m]$, $Origin~=~[1.35,~0.5,~0.4]~m,~m,~m$ and $Orientation~Specification~=~Disk~Normal~and~Coordinate~System$. Users should note that these settings is based on the experimental conditions and rotor geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Virtual Disk\\Inflow Specification</span> folder is the place to define the place within the CFD domain to lookup the incoming component of the streamwise velocity upstream of the rotor zone. This velocity component is used along with the angular component of the velocity to estimate the local body forces on the cells of the rotor zone. In this case study The <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Virtual Disk\\Inflow Specification/Method</span> is set to <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Inflow Velocity Plane</span> and set the radius and offset distance of this plane to 0.225 [m] and -0.9 [m] based on the origin of the CFD domain at the origin of the rotor face.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last but not least user set the angular speed of the blade in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Virtual Disk\\RotationRate</span> to 35.16 radian/sec coming from turbine's operating conditions of the turbine in experiment. This setting would fully set the geometrical and operational conditions of the turbine modeled via the 1D Linear Momentum model.\n",

    "In this step, it is highly recommended to use the default options and settings for the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Solvers</span> folder as it was pre-set based on the set options for the numerical models. Unless based on physics of the problem the user is aware of any specific choices. Furthermore upon non-smooth convergence and potential divergence of the CFD simulation user can modify and examine various solution methods. To modify the solution methods and controls users should look into available options under <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Solvers</span> folder.\n",

It is worth to mention that STAR-CCM+ lets it's users to visualize the evolution of flow field variables once the simulation is started to run. It order to enable this option users should use <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Scenes/Scalar Scene 1/Displayers/Scalar 1/Scalar Field</span> and choose the field of interest (e.g. Velocity in x-direction) to visualize it's evolution as the simulation converges.\n",
