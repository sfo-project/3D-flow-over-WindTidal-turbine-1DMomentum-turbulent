    "# CFD Problem's Physics & Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "**In developing CFD simulation for a fluid mechanics problem understanding the general physics and fundamental theory of the problem is extremely important. This knowledge would provide user the ability to make logical decision about the geometry of CFD domain, choice of proper boundary conditions and numerical models for the CFD simulation setup. Furthermore, user will have a general big picture of the expected results from simulation. These knowledges and abilities form the foundation for a successful and accurate implementation and possibly validation of the CFD simulation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words understanding physics and theory of problem before developing a CFD simulation can be thought of turning on a flash light prior to taking any step in a completely dark room. Hence, let's review the fundamental physics and theory behind the problem of \"3D Flow Around and in the Wake of a Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbine Simulated via 1D-Linear Momentum Model\" as the first step for development and validation of CFD simulation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the demand for investigations and developments on renewable energy technologies increases in both academia and industrial fields, the attempts to develop and use of computationally inexpensive CFD models to simulate the performance and flow field of these technologies increase respectively. Horizontal axis wind and tidal turbines are two example of the renewable technologies that have been experiencing this trend. From a purely fluid mechanics point of view for analysis of flow over a turbine; the free stream flow with a known available momentum approaches the turbine blades. The flow rotates the blades and creates a pressure drop and velocity deficit within the flow as shown with a sketch in Fig. 1. However, due to the complexity in the aero- and/or hydrodynamic shape of the turbine and physics of the flow at various points along the blade span simulating the details of the flow in this problem is complicated.\n",

    "Fig. 1 - The schematic of the flow and turbine interaction. The flow rotates the turbine blades via it's momentum. This will lead into a pressure drop and velocity deficit in turbine's wake.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tremendous amount of research and development was done to develop new and accurate CFD models and/or evaluate the currently existing models to simulate the flow field around horizontal axis wind and tidal turbines. Among all these models the **1D Linear Momentum** model, which is an implementation of the linear momentum theory within **STAR-CCM+** recently has gained lots of attention and popularity due to it's robustness and compatibility to be integrated with other numerical models in **STAR-CCM+** (i.e. RANS solver). The 1D Linear Momentum simulates the effect of the rotating blades on the fluid through a volumetric body forces acting inside a disk of fluid with an area equal to the swept area of the turbine's rotating blades. The value of the body force is averaged over a cycle of rotation from the forces calculated based on the **1D Linear Momentum** model. In this model, the blade is divided into small annular elements (rings) from root to tip as shown in Fig. 2: \n",

    "Fig. 2- The blade span geometry is divided into annular elements (rings) to calculate body forces based on the 1D Linear Momentum model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the streamwise flow interacts with the turbine there will be two main force components acting on the turbine blades. One component is the axial force known as the **Thrust or Drag** force. The other is the tangential force to the rotor plane known as **Torque or Lift** force. The vector summation of these two components will result into equivalent force component extract from the flow via turbine. These force components are estimated based on the **1D Linear Momentum** theory as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thrust Derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the net thrust acting on the entire turbine's rotor face as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T~=~\\frac{1}{2}~\\rho~V_0^2~C_t~\\pi~(R^2-R^2_{hub}),~ ~ ~ ~ ~(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the flow density, $V_0$ is the flow free stream velocity, $C_t$ is the thrust coefficient and $R$ is the radii distances within the rotor face. Based on this equation, the differential form  of the thrust on an annular finite element of width $\\Delta r$ and radius $r$ will be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta T~=~\\frac{1}{2}~\\rho~V_0^2~C_t~2\\pi~r~\\Delta r.,~ ~ ~ ~ ~(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining of equations 1 and 2 the differential form of thrust can be written as function of the net thrust and geometry of the rotor face:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta T~=~T~\\frac{2r~\\Delta r}{R^2-R^2_{hub}}~ ~ ~ ~ ~(3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the elemental thrust per unit volume of the rotor disk with thickness of $\\delta$ is defined using equation 3 as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta V}~=~\\frac{\\Delta T}{2\\pi r\\delta dr}~=~\\frac{T}{\\delta\\pi (R^2-R^2_{hub})},~ ~ ~ ~ ~(4)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta \\pi (R^2-R^2_{hub})$ is the geometric volume of the rotor disk $V_{rotor}$. It should be highlight that this derived equation shows that local elemental thrust density is only function of the geometrical specifications of the rotor face and not the geometrical location of the elemental ring. Therefore, the value of thrust at each cell within the discretized CFD domain is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_{cell}~=~\\frac{\\Delta T}{V_{rotor}}V_{cell}~ ~ ~ ~ ~(5)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For more accurate estimation of the thrust value on each cell a geometrical scaling factor can be used as well. Readers are referred to **STAR-CCM+** documentation for details on that [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Torque Derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition applied torque to an annular ring of the rotor face, as shown in Fig. 1, is equal to the rate of change of the angular momentum $dL$ as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$dQ=\\frac{dL}{dt},~ ~ ~ ~ ~(6)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the elemental angular momentum $dL$ is defined based on Netown's second law of motion as elemental mass times the centrifugal acceleration as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dL~=~dm~\\omega r^2.~ ~ ~ ~ ~(7)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the term $\\omega$ is the constant angular velocity of turbine's rotor. Substituting equation 7 into equation 6 and using the definition of mass flow rate across the annular cross sectional area, as shown in Fig. 1, the elemental torque is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$dQ~=~\\frac{dm}{dt}~\\omega r^2~=~(\\rho~V_0~2\\pi~r~dr)(\\omega~r^2).~ ~ ~ ~ ~(8)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The net torque on the turbine's rotor face is therefore the integral of equation over the swept area of the turbine:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q~=~\\rho~V_0.~2\\pi~\\omega\\int_{R_{hub}}^{R}r^3~dr.~ ~ ~ ~ ~(9)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the derivation of thrust value at each cell, equation 9 can be put into equation 8 and elemental value of torque will be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Q= \\frac{4Qr^3\\Delta r}{R^4-R_{hub}^4}.~ ~ ~ ~ ~(10)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplier four in equation 10 comes from integral term. It should also be highlighted that the elemental torque value is a function annular element across the rotor face, compared to the constant thrust value (see equation 4).  \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage the value of torque per unit volume of annular ring is defined through equation 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta V}= \\frac{2Qr^2}{\\pi\\delta(R^4-R_{hub}^4),}~ ~ ~ ~ ~(11)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and within each cell of the annular ring is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{cell}=\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta V}.V_{cell}=\\frac{2Qr^2 V_{cell}}{\\pi\\delta(R^4-R_{hub}^4)}.~ ~ ~ ~ ~(12)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again for more accurate estimation of the torques value on each cell a geometrical scaling factor can be used. Readers are referred to **STAR-CCM+** documentation for details on that [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation of the Thrust (T) and Torque (Q) in each cell is done using the provided look-up table of thrust and power (torque) coefficients as a function of velocity on the define rotor disk within the CFD domain. The axial and tangential force components can be calculated using equations 13 and 14 with the obtained value of Thrust (T) and Torque (Q):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\text{axial cell}}= T\\frac{V_{cell}}{\\Sigma_\\text{All cells}V_{cell}},~ ~ ~ ~ ~(13)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\text{tangential cell}}=\\frac{Q.r_{cell}.V_{cell}}{\\sum_{\\text{ all  cells}} r_{cell}^2.V_{cell}}.~ ~ ~ ~ ~(14)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculated body force values will be put back into conservation of momentum equation (RANS equation). In this process the pressure and velocity in the entire flow field gets updated taking into account the presence of the turbine effect. This iterative process is repeated until a converged solution is attained. It should be highlighted that the imposed simplification of the turbine's rotating blade effect is proved to decrease the computational time and costs significantly at no cost on the accuracy of the model. The only limitation that the 1D-Linear Momentum simplification would lead to is incapability of the model to capture the physics of the flow field in the near wake region of the turbine. Although the general physics behind the 1D-Linear Momentum model to simulate the turbine's effect is simple, the implementation of the CFD simulations, including the CFD domain and simulation setup, has been shown to be complex at multiple stages. In the next section the detail of engineering challenges and their solution are presented and discussed in great details.  \n",
