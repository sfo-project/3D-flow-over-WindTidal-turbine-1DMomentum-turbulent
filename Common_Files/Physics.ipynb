    "**In developing CFD simulation for a fluid mechanics problem understanding the general physics and fundamental theory of the problem is extremely important. This knowledge would provide user the ability to make logical decision about the geometry of CFD domain, choice of proper boundary conditions and numerical models for the CFD simulation setup. Furthermore, user will have a general big picture of the expected results from simulation. These knowledges and abilities form the foundation for a successful and accurate implementation and possibly validation of the CFD simulation.**\n",

Thus, do not limit yourself to the following structure and feel free to implement your suggestion and changes. We can modify this structure based on new feedback.\n",

    "130.000 (30.000 corresponds to the Reynolds at the nozzle and 130.000 at the tip's blade)\n",
    "and the inlet velocity. Then the lift and the draft coefficients at different Reynolds numbers are obtained with the software Xfoil, then computed via a BEM method the software that gives us the thrust coeffcient and\n",

    "The is the simplest method, which requires a lookup table of coefficients of thrust and torque, as a function of flow speed.  As part of the virtual disk model, the 1D Momentum method can be used to model the effects of a wind turbine. The 1D Momentum method is restricted to the Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT). The 1D Momentum method is based upon one-dimensional momentum theory with wake rotation. The method imitates the effect of the presence of a wind turbine by adding a source term to the momentum equations. The source term accounts for both axial and tangential effects. The method requires the performance curves of a wind turbine, that is, the thrust coefficient and the power as functions of wind speed. An inflow velocity plane is used to compute the volume-averaged values for the velocity and the density of air. The inflow velocity plane is placed upstream of the wind turbine. This upstream velocity is used to extract the thrust coefficient and the power values from the performance curves.\n",
    "The method can be used to study wake effects of a single turbine or of a complete wind park. The 1D Momentum method is particularly useful for examining various MHK turbines plant layouts in to order maximize energy production. That is why we have chosen this last method.\n",
