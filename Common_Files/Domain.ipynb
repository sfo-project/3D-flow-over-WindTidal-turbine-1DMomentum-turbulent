    "# CFD Domain's Creation & Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "The RANS equation is a partial differential equation and in order to solve it thanks to a computer, it is necessary to create discrete compartments in the space involved in the problem. These compartments are called \"cells\" and all these cells constitute the mesh. The different equations are approximated in each cells and the computer is running as long as the solution seems to be enough accurate. There is several types of mesh depending on the shape of each cell (tetrahedron, quadrilateral pyramid, triangular prism, hexahedron...) and each type depend of the geometry of the computational domain. More the mesh is fine, more the results are accurate but the computational time is increasing with the number of cells. That is why a mesh convergence study is necessary, the goal consists in finding the compromise between the computational time and the accuracy of results.\n",

    "# How to mesh one turbine with its nacelle ?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1-  Geometrical shapes and convergence mesh study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our work, the domain is a quadrilateral flume so the mesh is made of hexahedron cells. The difficulty is to find the suitable mesh. \n",
    "As a first work, two MHK turbines were placed as shown in the flume in the figure 1 in order to study the efficiency of the second turbine with different mesh resolution.\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> Fig. 1 - The computational domain with two turbines.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refined the mesh in the rotor zone with a cylindric mesh around the turbine because high velocity gradient is expected and we wanted to feel the disk impact on the flow. At this stage of the meshing operation they are only two different meshes a coare one in all the flume and a finer one just around the turbine as shown in the following figure :\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">. 2 - The two different meshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this graph was plotted :\n",

    "<img src=\"./Images/mesh.JPG\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 3 - The computational domain with two turbines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of this graph shows that for around 7 million cells in the mesh, the different values (power, velocity...) are converging, so the grid retained the 7 million cells one. This is the better compromise between computational time and accuracy of the results. Then the size of the cells which is 1.5 cm is easy to obtain. Let us now focus on the modelization of the fine mesh around the turbine because its nacelle will be added to the turbine in order to get the effect of boundary layer generated by it and to be more close of the reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2- Addition of the nacelle and creation of a substract. \n",
    "\n",
    "A software like SolidWorks was used to create the nacelle of the turbine, we add it on the middle of the flume.\n",
    "As already said in ####1 the goal is now to get the effect of the boundarie layer generated by the nacelle. That is why a cylindric medium mesh was added all around the nacelle :\n",
    "\n",

    "</br>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 4 - The three meshes of the simulation and the nacelle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For information, the medium mesh is 8 times more precise than the coarse mesh, the fine mesh is also 8 times more precise than the medium mesh, so that the fine mesh is 64 times more precise than the coarse one.\n",
    "Then in the boolean operations a substract has to be made, it consists in erasing the volume of the location of the nacelle as a part of the flume and to declare the nacelle as a solid piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3- Wall treatment and settings of the prism layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software needs information about the characteristics of the walls, two options are proposed, slip condition when the surfaces are considered as free surfaces with no viscous effects or no slip condition when the walls are considered rough.\n",
    "The no slip condition was selected on the nacelle because the boundary layer has an important effect on the wake after the turbine. With this settings the properties of the wall have to be input, the default values E=9.0 and Kappa= 0.42 were let unchanged.\n",
    "After the settings of the surface of the nacelle the mesh directly in contact with the nacelle were modified by adding prism layer mesh : tab geometry/ Operation / Automated mesh and then tick prism layer. Then the settings input in the default controls Number of prism layer : \n",
    "Number of prism layers : 10\n",
    "Prism layer near wall thickeness : 0.1 mm\n",
    "Once remeshed this gives :\n",

    "\n",
    "Then the y+ values (which represents how fine the near wall mesh has been generated) have to be checked, because some turbulence models do not fonction with certain high or smal values of y+. With the SST K Omega turbulence model, all y+ values are approved. For information the y+ values on the surface of the nacelle are between 0.15 and 4.5.\n",
